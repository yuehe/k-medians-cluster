# k-medians-cluster
What is Cluster analysis?
- Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). 

What is k-medians cluster?

-  Partition n observations into k clusters. It calculates the median for each cluster to determine its centroid.

Result:

- We solved the k-medians problem with both an integer optimization approach(using AMPL) and
a heuristic approach (Kruskalâ€™s algorithm, implement in AMPL).


the clustering problem
can also be formulated as a minimum spanning tree problem.
