README.TXT FILE FOR GIDEN USER VERSION 4.0 ALPHA

GIDEN 4.0 is currently under alpha testing with two different
releases:
(1) "User Version" which includes the core environment
     and a pre-defined toolkit of solvers
(2) "Implementor Version" which also includes the
     components needed to add new solvers to GIDEN.

This README file is part of the User Version distribution, which
is available for alpha testing with Windows 2000/XP and other operating
systems.  Users who have a need for the Implementor Version should
contact the GIDEN development team.

This version has been tested under:
 > Windows 2000 SP3
 > Windows XP Professional SP1

NOTE: GIDEN MAY RUN WITHOUT DOWNLOADING A NEW JRE
(You may be able to skip steps (1) and (2) below)

Installation Process:
(1) Locate and download the proper JRE install file
    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html
    As of 2004/10/02 this defaults to 1.4.2_05
    Select the appropriate JRE version
(2) Execute and install the JRE
(3) After installation, Click on giden.exe 
(4) An introductory screen will appear for about 3 seconds
(5) The GIDEN controller window will then appear

If GIDEN fails to start in step (3) above:
- Click on the giden.bat icon
- The resulting error message will indicate the reason
  GIDEN failed to start.
- Implement steps (1) and (2) if they were skipped

In an effort to make the installation process as simple as
possible, we have disabled the registration prompt for GIDEN
4.0-alpha.  We still request that users complete the voluntary
registration at the GIDEN web site:
http://giden.nwu.edu/cgi-bin/GIDENreg

As noted on the registration page, all information provided is
for internal use only by the GIDEN project.
